# CoStar Hack for VTHacks 11
To run this project, download finalvtHacks11 and create a virtual environment. You will need to install pandas, flask, and scikit-learn in your virtual environment. After that you can run the project.

## HackathonHomeMLProject
This project was made within a 48 hour period for a hackathon. The project we decided on creating was a new website design for the
front-end and for the back-end we used sklearn's linear regression model to predict housing preference.

### Data Collection
In order to build the model, the data collection was intitially self created in order to save time and ensure the model and implementation
was working properly. However, it was our goal going forward to find real data and use that to predict preferences.
